    <h2>For you,</h2>

    <p>I just want to write you a quick letter about this moment we're sharing right now in our lives.
        Everything moves quickly. Time never stands still, and I know how fleeting every second is.
        Despite everything being so ephemaral, you will always be present in my life.
        And i hope to be present in yours.
<br>
       <br> Since the day you have come into my life it has been nothing but pure joy and happiness.
        Every day with you in it becomes brighter because of your oh so lovely laughter.
        Hope you never lose that laugh to what you're battling all the time.
<br>
        <br>You know you're one of the most intelligent and all-round people I've ever met.
        Each time you share your opinion i just can't help but to stare at you with awe.
        Just know that you're extremely talented and magnificent (I will make sure to remind you that)
<br>
       <br> Happy Birthday!
        Hope we can make even more great memories together this year.
        Love you,
        L
